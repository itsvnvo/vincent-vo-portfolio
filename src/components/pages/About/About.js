            <p>
                Hey everyone, my name is Vincent and i'm currently aspiring to make the move to be a
                developer, I
                have
                recently just started so I don't have a lot to show yet but I'm hoping to fill this up with
                as much
                as my
                work as possible. A little bit about myself is that I love to try new foods and try to
                become the
                possible
                best in what i'm currently into.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
);


export default Aboutme;
