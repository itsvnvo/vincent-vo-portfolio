                    <p>Little bit about my pass work history I use to be a pizza delivery driver from about 2014-2017
                        and then I
                        moved on to work at Park Place Lexus starting as a valet, and eventually moved my way up to be a
                        Internal
                        Service Writer.
                        I decided I wanted a career path for myself so I made the jump to try and be a developer.
